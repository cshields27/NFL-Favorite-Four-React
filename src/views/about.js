          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <div className="faq-entry">
            <h3>Are the spreads and over/unders locked in or do they change over the week?</h3>
            <p>
              The game lines will be updated frequently and will be finalized Thursday afternoons.
              Users can always update their picks as the lines change and up to game time - note that picking a favorite or underdog 
              is actually picking the favorite/underdog for the <i>matchup</i>, so a line change that results in the
              favorite switching will switch which team you picked. This means the game lines aren't truly locked in until Thursday.

              Occasionally, there may be small differences between the final lines on our site and the Vegas closing lines, especially 
              in the case of last-minute roster changes. In such cases, we use the siteâ€™s finalized lines for fairness. In games that
              are pick 'ems (PK), the home team is considered the favorite.

            <h3>When do picks need to be submitted?</h3>
            <p>
              Picks for each game can be submitted up to the start time - picks for unstarted games can be changed at any time.

              Users' win-loss records will be updated at the conclusion of each week's games. Once a week starts, league members'
              picks can be viewed by selecting the week in the Leagues tab.

            <h3>How does a spread work?</h3>
            <p>
              A spread is a type of selection where oddsmakers set a margin of
              victory that the favored team must win by. You can choose to
              either select the favored team to win by more points than the spread, or
              the underdog team to lose by fewer points than the spread. For example,
              if you choose the favorite when the spread is -6.5, you need them to win
              by 7 or more for your selection to win! Likewise, the underdog in such a
              matchup can lose by 6 or less (or win, of course!), and your pick still wins!
              Your goal is to pick a correct favorite and underdog every week.

            <h3>How does an over/under work?</h3>
            <p>
              An over/under involves speculating on the total combined points scored by both 
              teams in a game. Oddsmakers set a predicted total, and you choose whether the 
              actual total will be over or under that prediction. For example, if the over/under
              is 44.5, scores such as 41-33 (74 total points) and 38-7 (45 total points), would
              result in a winning result for the "over". Scores such as 13-9 (22 points) would of
              course hit the under! Your goal is to pick a correct over and a correct under every week.
